        <strong>Introduction:</strong> Robotics is the study and creation of robotsâ€”machines that can perform tasks on their own or with little help. It combines different fields like engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI) to build robots that can work efficiently in different environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fact 1:</strong> A robot has important parts such as sensors, actuators, controllers, and software. Sensors help it detect surroundings, actuators allow movement, controllers process information, and software gives instructions. These parts work together to help robots complete tasks.
      </p>

        <strong>Fact 2:</strong> Robots are used in many different areas, such as factories, hospitals, space exploration, and homes. They assemble cars, assist in surgeries, explore planets, and even clean houses. Their ability to do different jobs makes them valuable in many industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fact 3:</strong> With AI and machine learning, robots are becoming smarter. Some can learn from experience, recognize speech, and interact with people. Self-driving cars, drones, and humanoid robots are examples of advanced robotics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Despite their benefits, robots also bring challenges. They may replace human jobs, raise privacy concerns, or be misused. As robotics grows, society must carefully manage its impact while using its potential for good.
